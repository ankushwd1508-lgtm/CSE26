  <h1><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h1>
  <p>Dussehra, also known as Vijayadashami, is one of the most important Hindu festivals celebrated across India with great joy and devotion. It marks the victory of good over evil, light over darkness, and truth over falsehood. The festival usually falls in the month of September or October, on the tenth day of the bright half of the Hindu month of Ashwin. </p>
  <h1>Mythological significance</h1>
  <h2>Dussehra has two major legends associated with it:</h2> 
  <ol>
    <li>Lord Rama’s Victory: According to the Ramayana, Lord Rama killed the demon king Ravana on this day to rescue his wife Sita. Effigies of Ravana, along with Meghnath and Kumbhkaran, are burnt across the country to symbolize the destruction of evil.</li>
    <li>Goddess Durga’s Triumph: In another tradition, Dussehra celebrates the victory of Goddess Durga over the buffalo demon Mahishasura. It is believed that Durga fought for nine days and nights and defeated the demon on the tenth day. This is why Dussehra is also linked to the festival of Navratri.></li>   
  </ol>
